# ModInstaller
My first official project.
We're now on version 1.0.5! Whoopee!
As of right now, this program only works if you're on *Windows*, though I'm hoping to someday adapt it to Mac too!
If you're interested in the EXE version, you can find a link to that [here]. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S67EfwUYDWvFSkEhWrULEExtPo20GyUk/view)

For the full usage of the application, you'll have to have the following items in the same folder as the program,
  *  mods folder   (must be lowercased, otherwise Minecraft won't accept it.)
  *  config folder (must be lowercased, otherwise Minecraft won't accept it.)
  *  options.txt
  *  optionsof.txt
